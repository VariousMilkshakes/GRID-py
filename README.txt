--Sam likes Woffles!--
This is a very simple game, as a bit of python pratice.
First set the height and width of the Grid you want to play in.
Then you set the X and Y starting position of "Sam".
Some were else on a grid a Woffle will spawn ("#").
Then you need to use the WASD keys to move Sam to the woffle.

Notes:
	1.Choose W, A, S or D then press enter, wait for grid to redraw before doing anything else.
	2.Very untidy code needs a good clean up.
	3.Planning on adding terrain which you have to navigate. Maybe difficulty system?
	Easy = 25% of Grid is covered. Medium = 50% of Grid is covered. Hard = 25% of Grid is covered.
	4.When I have cleaned up code I will put comments in it so you can see whats happening (some vauge variable names).
